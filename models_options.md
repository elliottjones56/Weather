Mostly just testing that this works properly

1. VARIMAX variants - the standard, showing proficiency here is a good start
2. Prophet - Meta made a forecasting model that I *believe* is different but not entirely sure how it works, this is industry leading type stuff so worth learning imo
3. Bayesian Time Series - Complicated, statsy, but cool and a more technical thing to demonstrate 2 in 1 knowledge of an obscure model and a MCMC type approach
