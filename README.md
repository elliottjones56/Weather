# Predicting Weather #

 ## Project Statement ##
 * We're going to make a webapp that predicts temperature in 5 major cities using time series data.
 

 ## Goals ##
 * Have a working webapp for project members to display on their portfolio.
 * Have project members gain active experience with time series(probably ARIMA), and weather APIs


 ## Methodology (Timeline 2 weeks) ##
 * 1: Data collection, through either google or weather APIs we will gather historical temperature data for 5 different cities. In this stage we will determine if we can pull historical data from the API or we need an older data set for modeling, I suspect we will need an older data set for trends, and can use APIs for current data.
 * 2: Data exploration, In this step we will determine what type of model, AR, ARIMA, MA etc to use and it's hyperparamaters to best predict a day's temperature data for a given city.
 * 3: Deployment, Finally we will deploy the working model to a webapp.
 * (Stretch), make the app work for any user-input city
